# MyDatabase-design-project
I designed this database to help track workouts and fitness goals in a clear, organized way. The main tables—Users, Workout Plans, Exercises, and Sessions—cover everything a user needs to log workouts and progress. I've been trying to use junction tables, but I'm not yet sure if I've done this correctly The goal is to to handle cases where one workout has many exercises and exercises appear in many workouts. This keeps the data clean and avoids repeats. One challenge was making sure all the relationships made sense and the keys were set up right so the data connects properly. I also wanted the design to be flexible enough to handle different workout types and goals. The sample data in Excel matches the tables and should make testing and building easier. Overall, I think this design will help users and trainers track fitness in a useful way
